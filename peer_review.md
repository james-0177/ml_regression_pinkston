1. Clarity & Organization (Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?)  **<span style="color: teal">The notebook is generally easy to follow, and the workflow is logical. However, it’s somewhat difficult to locate specific details about feature selection and the justification for choosing them. A suggestion would be to clearly label sections or include a brief explanation of why each feature was used — this would make it easier for readers to understand the rationale behind the modeling choices.</span>**

2. Feature Selection & Justification (Do the chosen features make sense given the objectives?)  **<span style="color: teal">The chosen features make sense for the objective of predicting whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible. They include relevant characteristics such as cap shape, gill color, and odor, which are known to influence edibility. One suggestion for improvement would be to briefly explain why each feature was selected or to highlight any features that were excluded, so readers can understand the reasoning behind the input variables.</span>**

3. Model Performance & Comparisons (Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?)  **<span style="color: teal">The notebook focuses on logistic regression for visualizations, including confusion matrices and ROC curves. However, the decision tree and random forest models lack similar visualizations. Providing confusion matrices, ROC curves, or other evaluation metrics for all models would improve comparability and make performance differences easier to interpret.</span>**

4. Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)  **<span style="color: teal">The notebook does not include reflections or insights about the modeling process. Including observations about feature importance, model behavior, overfitting, or potential improvements would strengthen the notebook. Even short reflections per model could help the reader understand why certain decisions were made and what could be improved.</span>**
